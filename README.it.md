## Introduction

The project consist of creation of a counter that allows the user to increase and drecrease value by 1, wich initially will be 0.
The user can use "+" and "-" buttons.
In addition to the basic functions, there is a Reset button that allow to reset the value of the counter to zero.


## Structure


The structure of the project is:

index.html: contains the backbone structure of the project, in which the style sheet (CSS) for the graphics of Falling-stars and the script for the functions are inserted.

styles.css: the style sheet with which I created the style and graphics.

script.js: script used to create the various HTML elements and the counter functions (increase/decrease, reset).


## Tecnology used


I used several technologies to create the Falling-stars counter:

Visual Studio Code, as editor for writing the code.
Pinterest for obtaining the immage.
HTML, to crate the container for the immage.
CSS played a crucial role in providing the project with an aesthetic appearance and ensuring responsiveness through Media Queries.

Finally, JavaScript, the programming language of choice, was used to implement the counter functionality and integrate it with some HTML elements."

## Usability
Using the counter is very simple. The counter value is increased and decreased by 1 with a click on the +/- buttons. To reset the current value user must click on the reset button.
This program was designed for recreational use. The user watch the photo and count the falling-stars, after it increase the value counter for each star.
